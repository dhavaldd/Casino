	The link which I referred was

	After working on this, I found a tool Windows Builder which made building GUI for Black Jack and Poker way more easy
	
2. BlackJack
	I have kept the very basic function of Black Jack game i.e Hit and Stay

3. Poker
	Poker has many variables going around but managed to take care of most of the variable but for the Evaluating Hand part I had to take help from online.
	Poker evaluator has many scenario to take care of which I referred here

Even tried doing multiplayer for BlackJack and Poker but couldn't finish it on time so didn't commit those changes on git.
